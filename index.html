			<h1>My Vision</h1>
			<p>Human beings can harness the complexities of the mind, the wisdom of the body, and the fearlessness of the heart to regain clarity when they are hurting, feel dissatisfied, or are confused about how to make changes. Suffering can leave us hopeless and disconnected, but it also reveals our innate capacity to wrestle with life’s multifaceted realities and possibilities. My integrative approach guides you into wholeness, recognizing that your best qualities are who you are and who you are becoming. </p>
			<p>I am a Licensed Master Social Worker, with over 25 years of combined experience as a professor of social work and holistic practices, therapist, clinical supervisor, and consultant. I work with children and adults and am skilled in various evidence- and practice-informed somatic, healing, and integrative approaches. After teaching social work practice for more than two decades, I expanded my practice to include end-of-life care. As an end-of-life doula, I provide emotional and spiritual support to individuals and families during the dying process. </p>
			<p>As a woman of color, I understand the impact of historical trauma and current social wounds inflicted on individuals, communities of color, and the world. I am aware of the need to learn about the experience of others, create safe spaces for honest discussion, address issues of oppression, and intentionally contribute to change.</p>
			<p>I have maintained a meditation practice for over 40 years and am ordained under the <a href="https://www.cafh.org/en" target="_blank">Cafh Order</a>. I am a Reiki practitioner, a Certified iRest Teacher, a Certified End-of-Life Doula, and speak Portuguese and Spanish fluently. </p>
			<p>I welcome you to prepare the ground and create new possibilities for a fulfilling, wholesome life.</p>

			<h3>iRest Yoga Nidra</h3>
			<p>My mother taught me to meditate at the age of 15, and I have explored many paths of unfolding since. I came to yoga Nidra through the practice of iRest® in 2016 and received certification through the Integrative Restoration Institute.</p>
			<p>iRest® yoga Nidra, is a guided meditation developed by Dr. Richard Miller based on the ancient nonduality teachings of yoga. iRest teaches us that everything we experience (every fear, anxiety, anger, hurt, depression, etc.) awakens us to our innate wisdom that reveals the right action required in each situation life presents. The Integrative Restoration iRest® meditation explores a wide range of emotions, thoughts, and sensations, reconnecting us to our wholeness, to others, and the world.</p>
			<p>Services include individualized interventions and private sessions to address sleep disturbances, emotional challenges, and mental and physical balance.</p>
			<p>Cost:<br> 60-minute session - $80</p>
			<h3>Reiki</h3>
			<p>Our hands are said to be an extension of our heart, and we use our hands to amplify our emotions, desires, and words. My desire to emulate my grandmother’s healing gifts through her hands brought me to Reiki. I saw her health-giving capacity operating numerous times, as she placed her hands on an individual’s forehead, closed her eyes, and let the universal life energy use her as a vessel to alleviate their suffering. </p>
			<p>Cost: <br>60-minute session - $45</p>
